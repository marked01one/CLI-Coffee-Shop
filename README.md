# Marked's Coffee Shop
 
#### A simulation of a coffee shop using the command-line interface!

## Planned features:
  + An updated ASCII menu board created using prettytable
  + A resources inventory containing water, milk, and coffee, alongside potential addons such as sugar and cream
  + Capability to receive personalized order sentences that utilizes natural language processing (maybe?)
  + For an admin: ability to check amount of resources left in inventory & amount of money received, refill on lacking resources, and even add or remove different flavours of coffee.
  + Admin abilities safely secured behind a 2FA system using phone messages via the Twilio API.
  + And more...

## To open the Cafe, use this command:
  
  ```
  python [full file path goes here]/main.py
  ```
Currently looking into a more elegant way of opening the Cafe, but for now, this is the most optimal option.
